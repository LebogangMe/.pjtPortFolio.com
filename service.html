                                    <p class="subtitle"> I know that Web developers rarely work completely on their own, and a strong ability to communicate is a great trait for programmers. we will often work with project managers, UX and UI teams, and clients, requiring good communication skills.
                    
                                        
                                        Web development is an in-demand skill in every industry sector. Whether I want to work at a startup tech company, in healthcare, finance, creative agency, for the public sector, or a mixture of all these, learning web development gives me the opportunity to get my foot in the door anywhere. 
                                        
                                         It starts with learning coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript that let me take command of the Internet. I don’t need a bachelor’s degree to get into programming. Whether I want to study part-time or full-time, the web development bootcamps  provide a structured and immersive training environment to develop, grow, and practice these new skills.
